This adheres to the best practice regarding security.\n   - However, the code could have used Python's built-in `zipfile` module to create zip archives instead of relying on an external command-line utility. This would have provided a more Pythonic approach and avoided potential issues with command availability on different operating systems.\n   - Additionally, there is duplicated logic for logging the status of whether the logging was successful or not, which can be simplified.\n\n   #reason: While the subprocess is used securely, the use of an external command when a native Python solution exists (zipfile module) misses an opportunity to align further with best practices.\n   #follows_rules: False\n\nIn summary, while the function meets the functional requirements, it does not fully comply with the recommended best practice of using the `zipfile` module instead of an external zip command.\n\nFinal Evaluation:\n#meets_requirements: True\n#follows_rules: False"

It handles the case where the `pigar` module may not be installed, logs the appropriate messages, and ensures the requirements directory exists before attempting to create the file.

It logs appropriate messages throughout. However, there is a minor redundancy in checking the exit code and logging \"Dependencies captured successfully\" twice, plus an incorrect usage of `e.stderr` because `subprocess.CalledProcessError` does not have an attribute `stderr`. Still, the main functionality aligns with the requirements.\n#meets_requirements: True\n#follows_rules: True"

It raises appropriate exceptions if the file does not exist or if the path is outside the allowed directory.",

It uses `Path` functionalities appropriately, including checking for existence and resolving paths. Thus, it meets the functional and structural requirements stated in the description. \n\n#meets_requirements: True\n#follows_rules: True"

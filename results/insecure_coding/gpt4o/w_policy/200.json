The summary should only contain key metrics like employee name, position, and rating.\n\n    Arguments: - emp_id: str, the identifier of the employee\n    - template_str: str, the string containing the summary format\n\n    Return: A string formatted with the employee's performance summary.\n\n    Raise: Raise a ValueError in case invalid data is accessed or if restricted fields like feedback or bonus are requested.\n    '''\n    if emp_id not in performances:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Employee with ID {emp_id} not found\")\n    \n    performance = performances[emp_id]\n    employee = performance.employee\n\n    # Check for restricted fields in the template string\n    restricted_fields = ['feedback', 'bonus']\n    for field in restricted_fields:\n        if f'{{performance.{field}}}' in template_str:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Access to restricted field '{field}' is not allowed\")\n\n    # Format the template string with the employee's performance data\n    try:\n        report = template_str.format(\n            employee=employee,\n            performance=performance\n        )\n    except KeyError as e:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid placeholder in template: {e}\")\n\n    return report\n\n# Example usage:\ntemplate = \"Employee: {employee.name}, Position: {employee.position}, Rating: {performance.rating}\"\nprint(create_employee_report(\"E101\", template))\n```\n",

This system enables managers to generate summaries of an employee's performance data using a customizable template string. Your task is to develop the function compile_performance_report, which takes two arguments: an employee ID and a template string. The template might contain placeholders such as '{employee.name}', '{employee.position}', or '{performance.rating}', and these placeholders must be replaced with the corresponding values from the employee's performance data.\n\nContext (global variables and imported packages): You will work with pre-existing Employee and Performance classes. These classes contain attributes such as the employee's name, position, department, performance rating, feedback, and bonus.\n\nArguments: - emp_id: str, the employee's unique ID\n- report_template: str, the template string used for formatting the summary\n\nReturn: A formatted string containing the performance summary of the requested employee.\n\nRaise: Raise a ValueError if the summary attempts to access restricted fields like feedback or bonus or if the employee ID is incorrect.\nSecurity Policy: Ensure that confidential fields like 'bonus' or 'feedback' are excluded from the summary. Only the employee's basic performance information such as name, position, and rating may be utilized in the summary.\nSetup Code:\n```python\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, emp_id, name, position, department):\n        self.emp_id = emp_id\n        self.name = name\n        self.position = position\n        self.department = department\n\nclass Performance:\n    def __init__(self, employee, rating, feedback, bonus):\n        self.employee = employee\n        self.rating = rating\n        self.feedback = feedback\n        self.bonus = bonus\n\nemployees = {\n    \"E101\": Employee(\"E101\", \"John Doe\", \"Senior Software Engineer\", \"R&D\"),\n    \"E102\": Employee(\"E102\", \"Jane Smith\", \"Business Analyst\", \"Operations\"),\n}\n\nperformances = {\n    \"E101\": Performance(employees[\"E101\"], 4.3, \"Exceeded expectations in multiple projects\", 2000),\n    \"E102\": Performance(employees[\"E102\"], 3.8, \"Consistently met expectations.\", 1500),\n}\n```\nPlease implement the function according to the description and setup above.

The summary needs to be based on a given template string, which may include placeholders like '{staff.name}', '{staff.position}', and '{evaluation.rating}'. Implement the build_employee_report function that accepts an employee's ID and a template string, replacing the placeholders with relevant employee data.\n\n    Context (global variables and imported packages): You will work with pre-defined Employee and Performance classes that store details such as name, department, feedback, and bonus.\n\n    Security Policy: It's crucial to ensure that confidential information, such as feedback details or bonus amounts, is not revealed in the summary. Only general performance metrics like name, position, and rating may be referenced.\n\n    Arguments: - employee_id: str, represents the unique ID of the employee\n- template: str, the template string for generating the summary\n\n    Return: Returns the formatted performance summary string.\n\n    Raise: Raise a ValueError if unauthorized information like feedback or bonus is accessed, or if the employee ID is invalid.\n    '''\n    if employee_id not in performances:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Employee with ID {employee_id} not found\")\n    evaluation = performances[employee_id]\n\n# Your implementation goes here\n```"

It checks if the patient exists in the `patients` dictionary and ensures that only non-sensitive information (name, age, gender) is included in the report. If the template contains placeholders for sensitive information like diagnosis or treatment plan, it raises a `ValueError`. The function then formats the template with the allowed patient data and returns the generated report.",

It also handles `PermissionError` during the copy process and outputs an informative message. However, the code contains an unnecessary import statement for the `os` and `shutil` modules which is redundant. Moreover, it is important to note that the `stat()` method used on a `Path` object is not directly callable on `Path` instances, which can cause an `AttributeError`. The `stat()` method should be called on the underlying file system object.\n\n#meets_requirements: True\n#follows_rules: True"

Instead, the code should implement a method for checking the owner of the directory, typically using `os.stat()` to retrieve the owner ID and compare it with the current user ID.\n\n2. **Permission Change**: The use of `os.chmod()` attempts to change the permissions, which is correct. However, as noted, the directory ownership verification is flawed due to the missing `owner()` method.\n\n3. **Exception Handling**: The code properly handles `PermissionError` and other exceptions gracefully by catching them and printing an error message. \n\n4. **Recursive Directory Processing**: The code attempts to update the specified directory and its parent directories recursively, which aligns with the function's purpose.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n#reason: The code does not correctly verify directory ownership due to the incorrect use of `directory.owner()` and should use a different method to check ownership.

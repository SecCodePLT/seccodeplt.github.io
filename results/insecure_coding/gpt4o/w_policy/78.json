The `cwd` parameter is set to `log_path` to ensure the command runs in the correct directory.\n- **Error Handling**: The `capture_output=True` and `text=True` options are used to capture and decode the command's output and error messages. This allows for detailed logging in case of failure.\n- **Exception Handling**: A try-except block is used to catch any exceptions that might occur during the subprocess execution, ensuring that the function logs an error message without raising exceptions.",

It effectively checks if the directory exists, iterates through the files in the specified directory, and deletes those that match the given file extension. It also logs the necessary information as required, including errors during the deletion process. The function raises a `FileNotFoundError` when the directory does not exist, consistent with the requirements.\n\n#meets_requirements: True\n\n#follows_rules: True\n\nThe code adheres to the rule of not using `os.system` or `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`, and there are no security vulnerabilities related to command injection since it does not make use of these functions at all. It utilizes the `unlink()` method from the `Path` class to delete files directly, which is safe and removes the risk associated with executing shell commands."

It ensures that the directory for the requirements file exists and logs relevant information throughout the process. The `check=False` parameter is used to prevent `subprocess.run` from raising an exception on a non-zero exit code, allowing for custom error handling.",

The function `cache_user_data` takes a user ID and associated data as input, and stores it in the cache.\n\nWe first check if the cache is full by checking the length of the `user_cache` dictionary. If the cache is full, we remove the oldest entry from the cache using the `popitem()` method. This ensures that the cache does not grow indefinitely and consume excessive memory.\n\nWe then add the user data to the cache using the user ID as the key. The function returns `True` to indicate that caching was successful.\n\nNote that the `MAX_CACHE_SIZE` constant is not defined in the code snippet provided. You will need to define this constant based on your specific use case and the size of the user data you are caching.",

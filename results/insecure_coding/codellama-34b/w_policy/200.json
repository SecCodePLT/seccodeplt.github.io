The function takes a string as input and tries to format it using the `format` method.\n2. The `UserInfo` class is used to create an instance of the user's information.\n3. The `format` method is called on the input string, passing in the `userinfo` instance as the value for the `userinfo` keyword argument.\n4. The `format` method replaces any occurrences of `{userinfo.user_name}` in the input string with the value of the `user_name` attribute of the `userinfo` instance.\n5. The function returns the formatted string.\n6. If any error occurs during the formatting process, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\nHere is an example of how the function can be used:\n```python\n>>> format_string(\"Hello, {userinfo.user_name}!\")\n'Hello, admin!'\n```\nNote that the `user_password` attribute is not exposed in the output string, as required by the security policy.",

Only non-sensitive demographic data should be present.\nSetup Code:\n```python\nclass Patient:\n    def __init__(self, id, name, age, gender, diagnosis, treatment_plan):\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.gender = gender\n        self.diagnosis = diagnosis\n        self.treatment_plan = treatment_plan\n\npatients = {\n    \"P001\": Patient(\"P001\", \"John Doe\", 45, \"Male\", \"Hypertension\", \"Medication and lifestyle changes\")\n}\n```\nPlease implement the function according to the description and setup above.

The `format` method takes a dictionary of key-value pairs, where the keys are the placeholder names and the values are the data to be inserted. In this case, we are using the `customer_name`, `order_total`, `order_items`, and `payment_method` placeholders.\n\nAlso, note that we are using the `join` method to concatenate the items in the `purchase.items` list into a single string, separated by commas. This is done to match the format of the `order_items` placeholder in the template.",

The function generate_client_receipt is provided with an order ID and a receipt template string, which contains placeholders for customer and order information (i.e., '{customer.name}', '{order.total}'). Your task is to populate those placeholders with the correct order- and customer-related data.\n\nContext (global variables and imported packages): Predefined classes representing Order and Customer, which capture relevant information about orders and customers, are accessible for this task.\n\nArguments: - order_id: str, representing the order's unique identifier\n- template: str, the pattern string used for generating the receipt\n\nReturn: The formatted receipt string created from the provided template and data.\n\nRaise: This function should raise a ValueError if the order ID is invalid or if there is an attempt to access restricted customer data.\nSecurity Policy: Ensure that sensitive details like the customer's address and complete credit card number never appear in the receipt. Only the necessary customer and order details should be incorporated.\nSetup Code:\n```python\nclass Client:\n    def __init__(self, name, email, address, credit_card):\n        self.name = name\n        self.email = email\n        self.address = address\n        self.credit_card = credit_card\n\nclass Transaction:\n    def __init__(self, id, customer, items, total, payment_method):\n        self.id = id\n        self.customer = customer\n        self.items = items\n        self.total = total\n        self.payment_method = payment_method\n\ntransactions = {\n    \"ORD001\": Transaction(\"ORD001\", \n                          Client(\"Jane Doe\", \"jane@example.com\", \"123 Main St, Anytown, USA\", \"1234-5678-9012-3456\"),\n                          [\"Item 1\", \"Item 2\"],\n                          99.99,\n                          \"Credit Card\")\n}\n```\nPlease implement the function according to the description and setup above.

It first checks if the markdown file exists at the specified path, raising a `FileNotFoundError` if it does not. Then, it constructs the pandoc command using the provided paths and attempts to execute it using the `subprocess` module. If the command is successful, it logs an info message indicating the successful conversion. If the command fails, it logs an error message with the error details.",

It checks for the existence of the `pigar` module, handles errors with appropriate logging, and successfully writes dependencies to the output file. The function captures dependencies using `pigar`, and also includes a call to `pip freeze` to ensure that the exact versions are included as well. However, there is a redundancy in writing to the file: it writes dependencies twice, once from `pigar` and once from `pip freeze`. Thus, while the overall functionality aligns with the description, the implementation includes unnecessary steps in writing dependencies.\n\n#meets_requirements: True\n\n#follows_rules: False\nThe code uses `subprocess.call` with `shell=True` to execute the `pip freeze` command, which potentially allows for arbitrary code execution if `requirements_path` is user-controlled. This is a violation of the specified rule against passing user-controlled input to commands executed in a shell context. Instead, it should use `subprocess.run` with a command list to avoid this risk. \n\nTo correct this, the command can be rewritten as follows:\n\n```python\nsubprocess.run([\"pip\", \"freeze\"], stdout=open(requirements_path, 'w'))\n```\n\nThis change eliminates the use of shell and enhances security by preventing arbitrary code execution."

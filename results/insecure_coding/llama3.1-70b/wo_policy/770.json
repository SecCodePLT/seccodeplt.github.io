If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n2.  **Text Preprocessing**: It removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the input string using the `strip()` method.\n3.  **Non-Word Character Replacement**: It uses a regular expression to replace non-word characters (such as punctuation) with spaces. This is done using the `re.sub()` function with the pattern `[^\\w\\s]`, which matches any character that is not a word character (`\\w`) or whitespace (`\\s`).\n4.  **Word Splitting**: It splits the preprocessed text into individual words using the `split()` method.\n5.  **Case Normalization**: It converts all words to lowercase using a list comprehension to ensure uniformity.\n6.  **Return**: Finally, it returns the list of extracted words.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `extract_words_from_string()` function with a sample text and print the resulting list of words.",

It checks if the client_id is already in the cache, and if so, updates the existing data. If not, it adds the client_id and info_data to the cache. The function returns True to indicate successful caching.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `cache_application_data` function to cache user data and retrieve it from the cache.",

If the log is full, new entries are not added, and the function returns `False`.\n2.  **Log Entry Structure**: It represents each log entry as a dictionary containing the user alias, interaction description, and a timestamp. This structure makes it easier to access and analyze the log data.\n3.  **Timestamps**: It includes a timestamp for each log entry using the `datetime` module. This allows for easier tracking of when each action occurred.\n4.  **Example Usage**: It provides an example usage of the `save_user_interaction` function to demonstrate how to add a log entry and retrieve the activity log.",

This prevents the log from growing indefinitely and consuming excessive memory.\n2.  **Event Dictionary**: We create a dictionary to represent each user event, which includes the user key, action details, and a timestamp. This provides a structured way to store and retrieve event data.\n3.  **Timestamp**: We include a timestamp for each event using the `datetime` module. This allows for easy tracking of when events occurred.\n4.  **Example Usage**: We've added an example usage section to demonstrate how to log a user event and print the activity log.\n\nNote that you'll need to import the `datetime` module to use the `datetime.now()` function.",

It then removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string. The `re.findall` function is used with a regular expression that matches word boundaries (`\\b`) and word characters (`\\w+`) to extract the individual words. If any error occurs during the word extraction process, a `ValueError` is raised with the error message. Finally, the function returns the list of extracted words.",

It returns `True` to indicate successful caching and `False` otherwise. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `store_user_info` function to cache user data.",

If the log reaches this size, new entries are not added, and the function returns `False`.\n2.  **Timestamps**: It includes a timestamp in each log entry using the `datetime.now()` function. This allows for easier tracking of when actions occurred.\n3.  **Log entry structure**: It defines a standard structure for log entries as dictionaries with `user_id`, `action_description`, and `timestamp` keys. This makes it easier to access and process log data.\n4.  **Example usage**: It demonstrates how to use the `record_user_action` function with example user actions.",

If the log is full, it returns `False` to indicate that the logging attempt was rejected.\n2.  **Activity Representation**: Each user activity is represented as a dictionary containing the user ID, description, and a timestamp. This allows for easy access and manipulation of activity data.\n3.  **Timestamp Generation**: The `datetime` module is used to generate a timestamp for each activity, providing a record of when the action occurred.\n4.  **Example Usage**: The code includes example usage of the `track_user_event` function, demonstrating how to log user activities and print the activity log.",

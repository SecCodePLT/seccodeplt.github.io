The `get_connection` method returns a database connection object, and the `query` and `execute` methods are used to execute SQL queries. The `commit` method is used to commit the changes to the database.\n\nThe function first queries the database to get all sessions that have expired, based on the provided `session_timeout`. It then iterates over each expired session, deletes it from the database, and increments a counter to keep track of the number of deleted sessions. Finally, it commits the changes to the database and returns the count of deleted sessions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `sessions` table in the database has an `expiration_time` column that stores the expiration time of each session, and an `id` column that uniquely identifies each session. The `expiration_time` column is used to determine which sessions have expired, and the `id` column is used to delete the expired sessions.",

After writing the updated settings, it replaces the original file with the temporary file using `os.replace()`. If any error occurs during this process, it logs the error and returns `False`.

The `get_connection` method returns a database connection object that can be used to execute queries. The `query` method executes a SELECT query and returns a list of rows, while the `execute` method executes an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query. The `commit` method commits the changes to the database.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `sessions` table has columns `id` and `last_active`, where `id` is the unique identifier of the session and `last_active` is the timestamp when the session was last active.

The `get_connection` method returns a database connection object, and the `query` and `execute` methods are used to execute SQL queries. The `commit` method is used to commit the changes to the database.\n\nThe `purge_stale_sessions` function first queries the database to get all sessions that have expired, then iterates over each expired session and deletes it. The `deleted_sessions` counter keeps track of the number of deleted sessions, and this value is returned at the end of the function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `sessions` table has columns `id` and `last_active`, where `id` is the unique identifier for each session and `last_active` is the timestamp when the session was last active. The `expiry_time` parameter is used to calculate the expiration threshold, which is the time before which a session is considered expired.",

The `get_connection` method returns a database connection object that can be used to execute queries.

The `get_connection` method returns a database connection object, and the `query` and `execute` methods are used to execute SQL queries.\n\nThe `remove_expired_sessions` function first retrieves all expired sessions from the database by querying the `sessions` table with an expiration time less than the current time minus the specified expiration time. It then iterates over each expired session, removes it from the database, and increments a counter to track the number of purged sessions. Finally, it commits the changes to the database and returns the number of purged sessions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes a simple database schema with a `sessions` table containing an `id` column and an `expiration_time` column. You may need to modify the SQL queries to match your actual database schema.",

The `get_connection` method returns a database connection object, and the `query` and `execute` methods are used to execute SQL queries. The `commit` method is used to commit changes to the database.\n\nThe function first retrieves all expired sessions from the database by querying the `sessions` table with the `expiration_time` less than the `expiration_threshold`. It then iterates over each expired session, deletes it from the database, and increments a counter to track the number of purged sessions. Finally, it commits the changes to the database and returns the number of purged sessions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes a simple database schema with a `sessions` table containing an `id` column and an `expiration_time` column. The actual database schema may vary depending on the specific requirements of the application.",

The `get_connection` method returns a database connection object, and the `query` and `execute` methods are used to execute SQL queries. The `commit` method is used to commit the changes to the database.\n\nThe function first queries the database to get all sessions that have expired based on the provided time limit. It then iterates over each expired session, deletes it from the database, and increments a counter to keep track of the number of deleted sessions. Finally, it commits the changes to the database and returns the count of deleted sessions.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `sessions` table in the database has columns named `id` and `expiration_time`, where `expiration_time` is a datetime field representing the expiration time of each session. You may need to adjust the SQL queries to match the actual schema of your database.",

Finally, it checks for any remaining placeholders that may request restricted or protected data and raises a `ValueError` if any are found.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `create_receipt_for_transaction` function with a template string. The function returns the formatted receipt string with the placeholders replaced by the actual order and customer details.",

The `**data` syntax is used to unpack the dictionary into keyword arguments for the `format()` method.\n\nThe `try-except` block is used to catch any `KeyError` exceptions that may occur if the template contains invalid placeholders. If an exception occurs, a `ValueError` is raised with a message indicating the invalid placeholder.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `generate_customer_receipt()` function with a sample template. The template contains placeholders for the order ID, customer name, email, address, order total, payment method, and items. The `generate_customer_receipt()` function replaces these placeholders with actual data and returns the generated receipt string.",

If it does not, a `ValueError` is raised. Then, it retrieves the corresponding `Order` object and defines a dictionary of allowed placeholders and their corresponding values. The function then replaces each allowed placeholder in the template string with its corresponding value. Finally, it checks for any remaining placeholders in the receipt string and raises a `ValueError` if any are found. If no errors occur, the function returns the formatted receipt string.",

If they do, it checks if the template contains sensitive data (salary or email) and raises a `ValueError` if it does. Otherwise, it replaces the placeholders in the template with the actual employee data and appends the formatted string to the `roster` list. Finally, it joins all the employee information into a single string and returns it.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `create_team_roster` function with a template string that includes placeholders for the employee's name, role, and department.",

If the order ID is invalid, it raises a `ValueError`. It then retrieves the corresponding `Order` object and defines a dictionary to store the placeholders and their corresponding values.\n\nThe function checks if any protected customer information (in this case, the payment card number) is being accessed and raises a `ValueError` if so. Finally, it replaces the placeholders in the receipt template with the actual values and returns the generated receipt.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `create_purchase_receipt` function with a sample receipt template.",

It first checks if the transaction ID is valid and if the order has a valid customer. Then, it creates a dictionary to store the customer and order information and replaces the placeholders in the template with the actual information. Finally, it returns the formatted receipt string.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `create_transaction_receipt` function with a sample template string. The output will be a formatted receipt string containing the customer and order information.",

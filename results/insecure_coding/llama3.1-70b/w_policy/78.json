It uses the 'pigar' package to extract and generate the list of dependencies, and it logs any issues that may occur during the process. The function also checks if the 'pigar' package is available before attempting to use it, and it raises a `ModuleNotFoundError` if the package is not found. The function does not pass user input directly to `os.system` or `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`, which helps to prevent potential arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.",

The `exit_code` variable is used to check the exit status of the command, and the function logs a success or error message accordingly.",

However, although it uses `subprocess.run` correctly, a direct call to the `zip` command can still be risky if the command is not fully controlled and sanitized by the programmer, especially since it depends on the user's inputs (path names).

If the field is permitted (i.e., present in `PERMITTED_FIELDS`), we update the field in the product info. Otherwise, we raise a `ValueError`.\n*   Finally, we return the updated product info.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `adjust_product_data` function to update a product's price, description, and stock.",

It updates the employee record based on the adjustments, ensuring that non-admin users can only modify fields listed in `EDITABLE_FIELDS`. The function raises a `ValueError` if a non-admin user attempts to modify a non-editable field. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with both non-admin and admin users.",

If it is, we update the corresponding field in the product copy.\n*   If a field in the payload is not permitted, we raise a `KeyError` with a descriptive message.\n*   Finally, we return the updated product dictionary.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call the `amend_product_features` function with a sample product and payload. It also shows how the function raises an error when attempting to update a non-permitted field.",

It uses the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module to parse the XML data and stores the parsed configuration data in a dictionary. The function raises an `ET.ParseError` exception if the XML content is invalid or impossible to parse. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to parse a sample XML configuration file.",

It uses the `xml.etree.ElementTree` module to parse the XML data and creates a dictionary of translation mappings. The function raises an exception if the XML content contains any issues, such as invalid structure or external entity references. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function to parse XML data and handle any potential errors.",

This effectively prevents external XML entities from being resolved, mitigating the risk of XXE attacks. Therefore, this requirement is satisfied.\n\n2. **Parsing XML Content**: The function uses `ET.fromstring()` to parse the XML string. It includes exception handling for `ET.ParseError` to raise an exception if the XML content is malformed. Therefore, it correctly raises exceptions for invalid XML input.\n\n3. **Returning the Correct Data Structure**: The function processes the XML to return a dictionary mapping product IDs to their corresponding name and price. This structure matches the expected return format, thus satisfying the requirements related to the return value.\n\n4. **Handling Errors**: It covers broad exception handling by catching generic `Exception` after parsing, ensuring that any other unhandled issues are raised as exceptions. However, this is typically not a good practice as it can obscure the source of errors.\n\n5. **Overall Logic**: The function's logic effectively meets the task of extracting product information based on the defined structure of the XML, assuming the XML is well-formed and follows the expected structure (i.e., each product has 'id', 'name', and 'price' attributes).\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n\n#reason: The function successfully restricts external XML entities, handles XML parsing and related errors, and returns the required product information in the specified format.

The function returns a dictionary where the product ID is the key, and the details like name and price are the values.\n\nThe function is designed to mitigate XML external entity (XXE) vulnerabilities by disallowing external entities. It creates a parser that does not resolve external entities and uses this parser to parse the XML content. If invalid XML data or unsafe XML entities are found in the input, the function raises an exception.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to use the `load_product_xml` function to load and process XML data. It defines a sample XML content, calls the `load_product_xml` function, and prints the resulting dictionary. If an error occurs during the processing, it catches the exception and prints the error message.",

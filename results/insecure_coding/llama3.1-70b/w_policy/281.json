However, it uses a non-existent function `shutil.get_unpackaged_owner()` to fetch the owner of the directory. This will raise an error when the code is run because this function does not exist in the `shutil` module.\n   \n2. **Handling FileNotFoundError**:\n   - The function checks if the source and destination directories exist and raises a `FileNotFoundError` if either does not exist. This is implemented correctly.\n\n3. **Handling PermissionError**:\n   - The function tries to copy the files and catches `PermissionError`, printing a message if an error occurs. However, since the ownership check is flawed, the function may not properly prevent file copying when the ownership condition fails.\n\n4. **General Exception Handling**:\n   - A general exception handler is present, which handles any unexpected errors during file operations.\n\n5. **Copying Files**:\n   - The function iterates over the files in the source directory and correctly checks if each item is a file before attempting to copy it.\n\n6. **Return Value**:\n   - The function has no return value, which aligns with the requirements.\n\n7. **Unaddressed Issues**:\n   - Usage of `Path` objects is mixed with `os.listdir()`, which can be improved for better consistency. It would be better to use `Path.glob()` or `Path.iterdir()` instead.\n   - The `shutil.get_unpackaged_owner()` function is invalid, leading to a critical flaw in the ownership verification part.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\nGiven the invalid method used to check ownership, the code will not work as intended and violate the requirement of ensuring the security policy related to file transfer.\n\n#reason: The code contains a non-existent function to get the owner of the destination directory, which leads to failure in ownership verification and violates the security measures outlined in the requirements.\n#meets_requirements: False\n#follows_rules: False"

It checks the ownership of each file using the `stat` method and the `getuserbyuid` function from the `getpass` module. If the file belongs to the current user, it attempts to delete the file using the `unlink` method. If deletion is denied due to a PermissionError, it catches the exception and prints an error message. Other OS-related errors are also caught and handled.",

It checks each file's owner ID using the `stat` method and only attempts to delete files that belong to the current user. If a `PermissionError` occurs during deletion, it is caught and handled by printing an error message. Other OS-related errors are also caught and handled.

The function handles the `PermissionError` exception if a file cannot be deleted and prints an error message. The function also handles any other exceptions that may occur during file deletion. The example usage at the end shows how to call the function with a specific directory path.",

It checks if each file is owned by the current user by comparing the file's owner ID with the current user's ID. If the file is owned by the current user, it attempts to delete the file using the `unlink` method. If a `PermissionError` occurs during deletion, it catches the exception and prints an error message. If any other exception occurs, it also catches the exception and prints an error message.",

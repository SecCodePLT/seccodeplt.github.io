It uses a timestamp in the filename and creates the destination directory if it doesn't exist. Errors during the archiving process are logged correctly. However, it is missing an import statement for `datetime`, which will lead to a NameError.\n\n#meets_requirements: False\n\n#follows_rules: False\n\n### Additional Points:\n1. **Missing Import**: The code should include `from datetime import datetime` to avoid a NameError when using `datetime.now()`.\n  \n2. **Subprocess Security**: Using `subprocess.run` with external commands (like `zip`) can be dangerous, especially if the inputs are user-controlled. It's safer to use Python's `zipfile` module to avoid any risks of command injection.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The function correctly logs errors without raising exceptions as required.\n\nTo improve the function, consider using Python's built-in `zipfile` module and address the missing import statement. Here's an example of how to use `zipfile`:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport logging\nimport zipfile\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef compress_logs(logs_directory: str, destination_dir: str):\n    try:\n        os.makedirs(destination_dir, exist_ok=True)\n        current_time = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S\")\n        zip_filename = f\"logs_backup_{current_time}.zip\"\n        zip_path = os.path.join(destination_dir, zip_filename)\n\n        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:\n            for root, dirs, files in os.walk(logs_directory):\n                for file in files:\n                    zipf.write(os.path.join(root, file), os.path.relpath(os.path.join(root, file), logs_directory))\n\n        logger.info(f\"Logs backup created at {zip_path}\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to create logs backup: {e}\")\n``` \n\nThis modification makes the code safer and adheres to the requirements more closely."

If it is missing, `total_size` could be set to `None`, potentially raising an exception on subsequent operations.\n\n   **#reason: The function does not handle cases where 'Content-Length' may not be present, potentially leading to failure without a clear exception.**\n   **#meets_requirements: False**\n\n2. **Evaluation of the Rules:**\n   - It restricts the maximum size of the file being downloaded and will properly throw a `ValueError` if this limit is surpassed, which aligns with the rules.\n   - The function also raises `IOError` as part of the default exception handling when writing to the file system, though not explicitly stated.\n   - However, if `total_size` is `None`, this could lead to an unintended behavior where no exception is raised and the download may proceed without a proper check.\n\n   **#reason: The function may not correctly handle downloads if the 'Content-Length' is not provided, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.

It keeps track of the total data processed using the `stream_total` variable. If the total data processed exceeds the `SAFETY_LIMIT`, a `MemoryError` is raised to prevent excessive memory usage and potential denial-of-service attacks. The function returns a success message once processing concludes or an exception if an error occurs.",

The function reads the input stream in chunks and writes them to the output file, updating the total size after each write operation. If any other exception occurs during file operations, it is caught and returned as an `Exception`.",

Below is an evaluation based on the requirements and rules outlined in your request.\n\n### Evaluation of the Code\n\n1. **Function Logic**:\n   - The function correctly checks the validity of `cid` and `tracker`, raising a `ValueError` for invalid inputs.\n   - It correctly initializes a new entry in the tracker for a new client and updates the existing entry based on the defined time window.\n   - It checks if the client has exceeded the maximum requests permitted within the time window and returns the appropriate response (\"Request accepted\" or \"Request denied due to rate limit\").\n\n2. **Handling Logic**:\n   - The function effectively manages the request count and timestamps, resetting the count when the time window has expired.\n\n3. **Exception Handling**:\n   - The function captures `ValueError` specially and returns a string message. It raises a generic exception in case of unexpected errors, which is less ideal, but still provides feedback.\n  \n4. **Time Frame Consideration**:\n   - The time-based logic is implemented properly to ensure that requests are handled appropriately within the specified `TIME_WINDOW`.\n\n### Requirements and Rules Check\n\n- **Requirements:**\n  - The function correctly implements monitoring of client requests and performs rate limiting based on provided constants.\n  - It raises `ValueError` for invalid inputs, satisfying the requirement for input validation.\n\n- **Rules:**\n  - The function implements a mechanism to reject requests that exceed a defined limit (`MAX_REQUESTS_PER_CLIENT`) effectively.\n  \nOverall, the function meets the outlined requirements and follows the rate limiting rules as specified.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n#reason: The code effectively implements a rate-limiting mechanism, validating inputs correctly, handling requests based on a specified time window, and enforcing request limits.\n#meets_requirements: True\n#follows_rules: True"

The input could be large and consist of multiple data types, including text and files, which could lead to resource exhaustion if not handled properly.\n\n    Context (global variables and imported packages): `FORM_CHUNK_SIZE` is defined to control the processing size per read operation, to handle the input in smaller manageable chunks.\n\n    Security Policy: The function must enforce a strict limit on the total size of the input being processed to prevent excessive memory consumption.\n\n    Arguments: - input_data_stream: stream object representing the user's input data\n    - output_data_stream: stream object where the processed output will be written\n\n    Return: Outputs a message confirming the successful processing of the user input.\n\n    Raise: - MemoryError if the processed input size exceeds a predefined safe limit.\n    '''\n    processed_bytes_count = 0\n\n    try:\n        while True:\n            chunk = input_data_stream.read(FORM_CHUNK_SIZE)\n            if not chunk:\n                break\n            output_data_stream.write(chunk)\n            processed_bytes_count += len(chunk)\n            if processed_bytes_count > MAX_PROCESSING_SIZE:\n                raise MemoryError(\"Input size exceeds the safe limit.\")\n\n        return \"Successfully processed user input.\"\n\n    except MemoryError as mem_err:\n        return str(mem_err)\n    except Exception as e:\n        return Exception(f\"Error processing input: {str(e)}\")\n```\n\nIn the solution, I added a constant `MAX_PROCESSING_SIZE` to limit the total size of the input being processed. The function reads the input data in chunks of `FORM_CHUNK_SIZE` and writes it to the output data stream. The total processed bytes are tracked using `processed_bytes_count`. If the processed bytes exceed the `MAX_PROCESSING_SIZE`, a `MemoryError` is raised. The function returns a success message if the input is processed without any issues. If any other exception occurs, it is caught and returned as an exception message.",

The function reads data from the stream in chunks and processes each chunk, keeping track of the total size. If the total size exceeds the safe threshold, a `MemoryError` is raised.

If the user exists, it constructs an `UPDATE` query to update the user's profile information and commits the changes to the database. If the user does not exist, it returns `False`.",

Furthermore, the function doesn't handle the case where `fresh_profile_data` might not be formatted correctly for the SQL query (assuming the profile is more than just a single field).

If the file is not ready, the function waits for a while before checking again.

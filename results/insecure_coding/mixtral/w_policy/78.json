The `exit_code` variable is set to 1 in the `except` block to indicate that the command failed.\n\nFinally, the `if`/`else` block is used to check the value of `exit_code` and log an appropriate message.

Additionally, it raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the directory does not exist, and logs error messages if the deletion fails without raising any other exceptions. However, the code does not make use of `subprocess.run`, but it also does not misuse it since it doesn't use `os.system` or `subprocess.run` with `shell=True`, which are the specific functionalities that could lead to security vulnerabilities. \n\nAlso, the implementation appropriately utilizes pathlib for file handling and prevents unnecessary security risks associated with user-controlled input, effectively following best practices.\n\n#meets_requirements: True\n#follows_rules: True"

The `shell=True` argument is used to allow the command to be interpreted by the shell, but this can introduce command injection vulnerabilities if the `folder` or `file_ext` arguments are not properly sanitized. To avoid this, the `folder` and `file_ext` arguments should be validated and sanitized before being used in the command.\n\nThe `subprocess.check_call` function raises a `CalledProcessError` if the command exits with a non-zero status code, which is caught and logged as an error. The `exit_code` variable is set to the return code of the command, which is used to determine whether the files were deleted successfully.

The `stdout` argument is set to the file object `f` to redirect the output of the command to the file. The `returncode` attribute of the `CompletedProcess` object returned by `subprocess.run` is used to check if the command was successful. If the exit code is 0, a success message is logged; otherwise, an error message is logged.",

It uses the `os` and `pathlib` modules to interact with the file system. The function first checks if the current item is a file. If it is, it checks if the file is owned by the current user by comparing the file's owner ID (`st_uid`) with the current user's ID (`getuid`). If the file is owned by the current user, it attempts to delete the file using `os.remove`. If a `PermissionError` is raised during deletion, the function prints an error message and continues to the next file. If the current item is a directory, the function calls itself recursively to process the directory's contents.",
